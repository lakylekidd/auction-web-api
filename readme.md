# Auction Project - Fullstack

In this project I will be implementing a fullstack sample project of an auction / buy-and-sell app.

## Requirements
My project will be built using the most popular technologies and frameworks:
* React-Redux
* Typescript
* Express JS
* SASS
* PostgreSQL

## Required User Stories
* As a seller I want to be able to add an advertisement to sell something.
* As a sellet I want to be able to create advertisements without logging or signing in.
* As a buyer I want to be able to view a list of advertisements as the first thing I see in the app.
* As a sellet I want to add a title description, picture (url), price, email address and a phone number to my advertisement
* As a buyer I want to view the title and price in the advertisement list
* As a buyer I want to be able to click on an advertisement and be able to see the description, picture (url), price, email address and phone number.

## Suggested Future Features
* As a new user I should verify my email address upon sign up.
* As a new user I should verify my phone number upon sign up.
